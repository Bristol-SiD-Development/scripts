## General problems with using ILC Dirac
- If sending off multiple jobs, there may be a delay between the job submission and the input being sent to the grid. Any edits after submission may be included!
- When completing the full Sim-Reco chain, if using a local zip file for lcsim slicPandora will delete it before it gets to the second lcsim stage. Make sure that you upload the zip file to a website (as described in SettingUpWebStorage.md)
