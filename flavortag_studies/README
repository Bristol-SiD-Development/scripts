#Flavortagging Studies

LCFIplus provides jet analysis and is an improvement on LCFIVertex. Once events have been fully simulated and reconstructed, LCFIPlus provides vertex finding, jet clustering and flavortagging of jets. 

In order to study how LCFIPlus performs, you need an LCIO file, with a PFO collection, i.e. it needs to have been run through slicPandora. LCFIplus requires weights files that vary depending on the detector geometry
