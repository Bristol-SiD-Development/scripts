Directory to put simple scripts based on the pylcio bindings

Because of the total insanity of some of what the pyLCIO methods return they are wrapped up in utility functions given in pylciohelperfunctions module 

The scripts pylcio-plot-masses.py and pylcio-plot-thetas.py do roughly what you'd expect (reconstruct the invariant mass / the theta value for the initial particle in each event in the file and plot them on a histogram)
